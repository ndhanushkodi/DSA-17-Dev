# Day 00: Getting set up + Interfaces

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
Check if you have Java installed:

`java -version`

If you get `The program 'java' can be found in the following packages:`, then
install it with:

`sudo apt-get install default-jre`

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

To install the JDK:

`sudo apt-get intall default-jdk`

## Installing an IDE

The IDE we recommend for this class is IntelliJ. If you have another preferred
IDE, that's fine. Here's how to install IntelliJ:

- Navigate to https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ and click Download.
- `cd ~/Downloads  # Assuming this is where your browser downloaded the file to`
- `tar -zxvf ideaIC-XX.Y.Z.tar.gz  # put the name of the file here`
- `cd ideaIC-XX.Y.Z  # this is the folder it was unzipped to`
- `./bin/idea.sh  # this runs IntelliJ`
- Set up IntelliJ according to your preferences!

# Play around with IntelliJ

Try to make and execute some classes, create some unit tests, and try to get acclimated with the environment. If you have any questions, make sure to email the instructors!
